# Web Tag for Google Tag Manager(web container)

The GTM Parambuilder enhances the integration of Google Tag Manager with Meta's systems to improve the quality and coverage of signals collected through GTM. It focuses on increasing the coverage of `fbc` and `fbp` parameters and improving matchability for GTM events, even in the presence of ad blockers. By integrating Parambuilder into client-side web container tags, advertisers can achieve better signal quality and coverage without requiring changes to the Parambuilder itself.

Google Tag Manager (GTM) supports the integration of Parambuilder for sharing customer actions with analytics partners directly from advertisers' servers.

This template is a tag that reads the standard event schema sent from the client running on a tagging server. It then enhances the event data to improve parameter coverage and matchability.
